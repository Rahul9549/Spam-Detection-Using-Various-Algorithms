# Robust Spam Detection System with Count Vectorizer and Machine Learning Algorithms

##  Overview:
This project is centered around the development of a robust spam detection system utilizing Count Vectorizer and various machine learning 
algorithms. By employing text data preprocessing techniques, feature extraction with Count Vectorizer, and implementing multiple 
classification algorithms, the system achieves high accuracy in accurately identifying and filtering out spam messages from legitimate ones.

## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to create a reliable spam detection system capable of accurately identifying spam messages using Count 
Vectorizer and machine learning algorithms.

## Methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters. Perform stemming or lemmatization
   to normalize the text.
2. Feature Extraction: Utilize Count Vectorizer to convert the text data into numerical feature vectors, representing the frequency of words
   in each message.
3. Splitting Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the performance of the machine learning models.
4. Model Selection: Experiment with various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
   Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to identify the most suitable model for spam detection.
5. Model Training: Train each selected model on the training dataset using the feature vectors generated by Count Vectorizer.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the
   testing dataset to measure its effectiveness in spam detection.
7. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing models to optimize their performance further.
8. Model Comparison: Compare the performance of different algorithms and identify the most accurate and efficient model for spam detection.

## Outcome:
The final outcome of this project is a robust spam detection system capable of accurately identifying and filtering out spam messages from 
legitimate ones. The methodology involves data preprocessing, feature extraction with Count Vectorizer, model selection, training, 
evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. The performance of each model is documented, and the best-performing model is selected based on 
evaluation metrics.
